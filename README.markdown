#Smali/Baksmali mode for Emacs#

##Overview##
Quickly through this together after seeing all the VIM smali syntax variantions.
I couldn't find one for emacs - and well, that's the editor I prefer so I mashed
this up. It's probably a really bad hack, but I've never made a mode for emacs,
currently I just used the default profile to load this in, feel free to commit and
make this better. Not everything is completed, but it's done enough to make reading
smali code much better already.

Enjoy!

##INSTALL##
===
Copy into your .emacs file in your home dir, if you don't have one, rename file to ~/.emacs
Load up a .smali file and enjoy!

##NOTES##
===
I personally use "//" comments, though these will not recompile in the publicly released
baksmali/smali packages.
